											*TestNG REPORT*
#We can generate the TestNG reports in two ways:
1. Emailable Reports (Go to test-output folder > emailable-reports.html > Rt.click > open with > web browser)
2. Index Reports (Go to test-output folder > index.html > Rt.click > open with > web browser)

#We can generate the TestNG Graphical reports by using:
1. Extent Report

										*TestNG EXTENTREPORT*
										
1. Used to generate the report in html or pie chart 
2. Add the dependency 
	<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.aventstack/extentreports -->
	<dependency>
    	<groupId>com.aventstack</groupId>
    	<artifactId>extentreports</artifactId>
    	<version>5.1.1</version>
	</dependency>
3. Create the new package (org.fxb.extentreport)
4. Create the new class (Reports)
5. write the below code 
	public ExtentReports addReports()
	{
		ExtentSparkReporter obj1 = new ExtentSparkReporter("Ex-Report.html"); 
		ExtentReports obj2 = new ExtentReports();
		obj2.attachReporter(obj1);
		obj2.setSystemInfo("Testing1", "Testing2");
		return obj2;
	}
6. Refresh the Project you can see the new folder created in the Project with the name you have given to your Suite in the TestNG.xml file
   (RegressionSuite in this case)
7. Whatever the Test test you have in your TestNG.xml file, there report is created in this folder with the name 
   you have given to your Test in the testng.xml file
8. Now whenever you have to see the Report of any perticular test you can see it
